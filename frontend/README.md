# Alva Tech Challenge - frontend

I've scaffolded a [nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) (Vue) app to make it easier for you. If you're not familiar with Vue, and you prefer to use React or another modern framework, please feel free to use something different.

I've also set it up to use `pug` and `stylus`, but feel free to remove/change those if you want to use plain html and sass or plain css. (remove `lang='pug'` or `lang='stylus'`)

### Prerequisites

1. Have a recent version of node installed, as well as yarn (`npm i yarn` or installed an alternate way)

You can check they're installed by running:

```
$ node -v
$ yarn -v
```

Then:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
