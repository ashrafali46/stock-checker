# Alva Tech Challenge

This repo contains the take-home challenge for Alva's tech interview process for full-stack engineers.

It contains two folders, `frontend` and `backend`, which contain individual but related challenges and instructions for both in their README.md files.

See [this document](https://www.notion.so/withalva/Alva-Tech-Challenge-Full-stack-ce58830c32a640fd81e86ba4a8cdec63) for instructions, tasks and designs.
