# Backend challenge

See the top level readme for more detail.

This is very bare-bones setup - I've included express, dotenv, and axios as packages to save you some time.

Feel free to use or not use that, it's up to you.

### Prerequisites

1. Have a recent version of node installed, as well as yarn (`npm i yarn` or installed an alternate way)

You can check they're installed by running:

```
$ node -v
$ yarn -v
```

2. Set up an env file with your preferred port

Then:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with reload-on-save at localhost:{port}
$ yarn dev

# test
$ yarn test
```
